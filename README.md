# house-price-analysis
This project aims to analyze and predict housing prices using a dataset containing various features of houses
The goal is to build a model that can predict the sale price of a house based on factors such as its size, location, condition, and more. The dataset includes information on property features, such as square footage, year built, number of rooms, and neighborhood, among others.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy
Model building using machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation and performance tuning
